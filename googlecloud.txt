GOOGLE CLOUD FOR DUMMIES

==GUIDES===

***NOTE: you do not have to follow the complete guide, most of hit has already been setup****

- Guide: http://cs231n.github.io/gce-tutorial/
- some extra tips from our course: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l4SVr0uU4Rw6srstD0QwLRdG6r_Ob-yqIeiUb0_q4zc/edit



==HOW TO SETUP==

Follow guide, hoever note that the folloing steps are already done
- "Create and Configure Your Account": you already have an account, it is in your gmail
- "Create an image from our provided disk": Has already been done
- "Launch a Virtual Instance", however you probably do need to start the created instance

Thus start at: "Connect to Your Virtual Instance"
Once you have downaloded Google Cloud SDK, just type:

	gcloud compute ssh --zone=europe-west4-a cs231-boot


==HOW TO RUN CODE==

Run:

	screen

This allows us to detach the code from the terminal, thus now we can close the terminal without stopping the code from running.

go to:

	USER@cs231-boot:/home/deepLearning


Now you can run any code with:
	
	python file.py


hide screeen session with
	
	ctr + A
	d

Now you can close your terminal, the code will keep on runnig

When reopening the code run

	screen -r

This allows you to acces the session where the code is running


==HOW TO TRANSFER FILES==

Use: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/transfer-files#winscp


*** NOTES ***

-Use you actual username NOT your email address
-Can can likely only copy to your personal directory, that is fine just move the file later.


==GPU==

Insepect cuda version:
	
	cat /usr/local/cuda/version.txt

Check if you have an GPU running 

	nvidia-smi

Check GPU usage

source .bashrc

==EXTRA==

Note that the CPU, GPU and memory is really low to save on cost, however when you want to run code you can easily increase it.

==Problem solving==

Q: When I run code it gets stuck at a certain part for a long time and returns "Killig"
A: check CPU usage of VM instance, if you are at 100% increase it (note that this cost more money).

Q: when installing packages I get permission denied
A: install with pip install package --user

GOOGLE CLOUD FOR DUMMIES

==GUIDES===

***NOTE: you do not have to follow the complete guides, most of it has already been set up****

- Guide: http://cs231n.github.io/gce-tutorial/
- some extra tips from our course: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l4SVr0uU4Rw6srstD0QwLRdG6r_Ob-yqIeiUb0_q4zc/edit


==HOW TO CONNECT==

Follow guide, hoever note that the folloing steps are already done
- "Create and Configure Your Account": you already have an account, it is in your gmail
- "Create an image from our provided disk": Has already been done
- "Launch a Virtual Instance", however you probably do need to start the created instance

Thus start at: "Connect to Your Virtual Instance"
Once you have downaloded Google Cloud SDK, just type:

	gcloud compute ssh --zone=europe-west4-a cs231-boot

==HOW TO RUN CODE==

-Run:

	screen

This allows us to detach the code from the terminal, thus now we can close the terminal without stopping the code from running.

-Run:

	source activate tensorflow

This activatesthe enviroment with everything set up properly

-go to:

	cd /home/deepLearning


- Now you can run any code with:
	
	python file.py


- hide screeen session with
	
	ctr + A
	d

Now you can close your terminal, the code will keep on runnig

- When you want to see how for the code is run:

	screen -r

This allows you to acces the session where the code is running


===COPY FILES FROM LOCAL DIR===

Use: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/transfer-files#winscp


*** Note: Use you actual username NOT your email address ***
** Note: Can can likely only copy to your personal directory, that is fine just move the file later. ***


====GPU====

-First check on cloud.google.com that atleat 1 GPU is selected
-Check if you have an GPU running 

	nvidia-smi

-Run:

	source activate tensorflow

-This opens the anaconda enviroment named "tensorflow" which has everything set up to run GPU(s).
-Verify that the GPU(s) are found with:

	pyton /home/deepLearning/tools/keras_gpu.py

-Check GPU usage

	https://towardsdatascience.com/howto-profile-tensorflow-1a49fb18073d

*** this might  be usefull ***

-Insepect cuda version:
	
	cat /usr/local/cuda/version.txt


== Memory profiling ==

Add a profile decorator to a function and run python with:

	mprof run <script>

plot results with:

	mprof plot

===REQUIREMENTS===

if you select an instance with too low specs it will crash, for downlaoding data RAM seems to be the limit:

1000km, 237 stations, >25GB

source .bashrc

/home/Taeke/anaconda3/bin/activate to /home/Taeke/.bashrc
A backup will be made to: /home/Taeke/.bashrc-anaconda3.bak

==EXTRA==

Note that the CPU, GPU and memory is really low to save on cost, however when you want to run code you can easily increase it.

==Problem solving==

Q: When I run code it gets stuck at a certain part for a long time and returns "Killig"
A: check CPU usage of VM instance, if you are at 100% increase it (note that this cost more money).

Q: when installing packages I get permission denied
A: install with pip install package --user
